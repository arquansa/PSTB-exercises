        "You‚Äôll design a smart emergency dispatch agent that assists in triaging 911 calls, gathering critical patient data, and dispatching appropriate medical services. You‚Äôll define its architecture, tools, state management, and evaluate the trade-offs between different agent types.\n",
        "\n",
        "üõ† What will you use\n",
        "Agent concepts: perception, reasoning, action loops\n",
        "Architecture types: reactive, deliberative, hybrid\n",
        "Tools & integrations: symptom‚Äêchecker APIs, dispatch scheduling systems, GIS/location services\n",
        "State management: memory of caller info, symptom history, decision logs\n",
        "Evaluation criteria: urgency determination, response speed, reliability, safety trade-offs\n",

        "Without session memory, the agent cannot track interrogation progress or evolving symptoms, cannot resume after call interruptions, and cannot make context‚Äëaware dispatch decisions\n",
        "It leads to repeated questions, mis-triage, poor audit trails, and inconsistent instructions. It effectively becomes a stateless reactive system, unsuitable for multi-turn medical protocols and high-stakes decision support.\n",
        "Research shows that reactive (memoryless) agents diminished ‚Äúsituation awareness‚Äù in evolving dispatch calls, whereas model-based agents that retain state maintained coherence and performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "Why are external tools (APIs, models) essential in an EMR dispatch scenario?\n",
        "\n",
        "Because accurate dispatch requires real‚Äëtime location data, traffic-aware routing, hospital capacity, and triage classification, external APIs (e.g. geocoding, traffic, facility availability) and trained NLP/triage models provide the necessary precision that an agent alone cannot infer.\n",
        "\n",
        "These components enable optimal ambulance assignment, dynamic routing adjustments, symptom-to-urgency mapping, and reliable audit trails‚Äîall proven to reduce EMS response times and improve patient outcomes when tightly integrated into a dispatch platform."
