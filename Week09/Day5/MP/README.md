#  Meta-Analysis on Large Language Models (LLMs)

This repository contains the final report for a mini-project analyzing and comparing recent publications on **Large Language Models (LLMs)**. The project was conducted as part of a course module focused on deep learning research analysis.

## ?? Project Overview

The goal of this project was to synthesize insights from **four articles** discussing different aspects of LLMs, such as:

- Technical foundations and architectures (Transformers, GPT, RLHF)
- Real-world applications and system building
- Reasoning limitations and evaluation challenges
- Alignment and ethical considerations

The final report (PDF) includes:

- A summary of each article
- A comparative analysis across models, methods, challenges
- Reflections on trends and future directions in the LLM space

?? **Deliverables:**
- `meta_analysis_llms.pdf`: The final 6-page meta-analysis report
- Tables/figures included for easier comparison and insights
